Install:

 Windows 7:
 * unzip the CountdownTimer_gadget.zip into: 
    %LOCALAPPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows Sidebar\Gadgets
    
 * hit the Windows start button and type "add gadgets", then enter when the 
   appropriate control panel appears at the top of the search results 
   * alternatively, right click on a desktop gadget and click "Add Gadgets..."
 * you should see Countdown Timer listed, right click and Add

 
  Background:
 
  The Countdown timer gadget was created as a learning project and because I needed 
something to remind me to take breaks throughout the day.  I wanted something that 
had a tiny footprint both in appearance and function, similar to the gnome-timer
applet (for Linux desktops).

  The concept is very basic - countdown from a preset time (in minutes) and alert 
when time is up. This gadget is more akin to a kitchen timer than a countdown-
until-my-birthday type timer.  However, the gadget will happily countdown 
135971947923 minutes in case that amount of time happens to be of value to you.


  Settings:
  
  As with any quality gadget or applet, this one is configurable.  The Custom 
Countdown setting (in minutes), if set, will override the default of 30 minutes 
and any Preset Timers selection (also in minutes).  Lastly, the Number of Alarm 
Sounds option defines how many times the audible alarm will sound when time is up.  
Putting a 0 in this option field disables it.

  (Slightly) Advanced Settings:

  To change the gadget defaults or if you wish to add or remove Presets, edit the 
global.js file. The presets list values are delimitated by two pipe characters "||"
so add or remove accordingly.


Thanks for using it!
