  Background:
 
  The Countdown timer gadget was created as a learning project and because I needed 
something to remind me to take breaks throughout the day.  I wanted something that 
functioned and appeared as simply as the gnome-timer applet.  Upon undiscovery,
motivation for Countdown Timer was born.

  The concept is very basic - countdown from a preset time and alert when time is up.
Thie gadget is more akin to a kitchen timer than a countdown until my birthday
type timer.  However, the gadget will happily countdown 135971947923 minutes in
case that amount of time happens to be value to you.


  Settings:

  The default countdown is 30 minutes.  The primary display has play/pause and 
restart buttons.  Settings include Custom Countdown, which is set in minutes,
with examples like 11 or 66 minutes.  There's also list of preset times, all are
also in minutes.  Lastly, the number of alarm sounds configuration defines how
many times the audible alarm sounds.


  (Slightly) Advanced Settings:

  To change the gadget defaults or if you wish to add or remove Presets, edit the 
global.js file. The presets list values are delimitated by two pipe characters "||"
so add or remove accordingly.
